Various arduino based testing programs and applications.

AVR is a marvelous microcontroller chip and arduino demonstrates to the world how simple building hardware platforms and programming could be. However, there are pitfalls especially for those who thinks things will work out of the box. This repository documents what I have done using various arduino boards and hopefully it will be useful for both me and those who come across it.
